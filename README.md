Bible journal and reading app

## What is it? 
There are many bible readers all over the places. however, personally I need customized bible reader and journal recorder for myself since there are few missing features. 

## Features I need
- Tab based bookmark: often time, I read multiple locations in bible at once for different reaons like family reading/personal reading/group study and etc. using bookmark from kindle or other apps was not enough to track since I need to set bookmark everytime new. tab would just remember the last location on each tab and it lets me not to create a new bookmark each time.  
- Indexing based on Book/Chapter
- Journal: recording journal is important part of reading bible since there are alot of things to remember from what was revealed each time. 
- BRI: along with Journal, recording BRI(Basic Required Information) is important thing. 
- Reader's mode: sometimes, I would love to read bible without having chapter/verse information. 

## Which technology will be used
- I would love to make this app for different devices. so I'll go with MDD from Visual Studio.
